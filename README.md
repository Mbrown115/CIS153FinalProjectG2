   Being that there were no face to face communication between the group members, there was a different take on how the project should be taken. Usually, there is opportunity for the group to work on the project at the same time and bounce ideas off of one another, and that wasn't present here. this issue shines more when there is no communication between students for the rest of the course, so there's no relationship with anyone and no idea of the others capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses. This is domminate just because of this class being online.
